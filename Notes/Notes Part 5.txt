Virtual Memory

- When the computer runs out of RAM, (because its all just going through each program one by one to handle the queue)

- Virtual Translation
	- A virtual address is stranslated to a physical address by a combination of hardware and software
	- (There is something about page faults?)
		- Replacement policies when we have page falls, which page do we kick out

- Thus it takes an extra memory access to translate a VA to a PA
- This makes memory accesses very expensive
- The hardware fix is to use a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) - a samll cache that keeps track of recently used address mappings
	- TLB can be organized as fully associative or direct mapped
