Future of Processing
These two guys I don't know who they are

Brain Chip - SyNAPSE
	- Dsigned by IBM, inroduced on Agusust 7th, 2014
	- different from a standard chip - event driven and runs only when necessary
	- does not use a clock

TurNorth (SyNAPSE)
	- the truenorth chip has accomplished the follwoing points
	- each point (transistor) is each individually programmable
	- modeled after the brain
		- allows cores to fail, allowing for the whole brain to keep working
	- async, because it doesn't run on a clock
	- but some things happen in time, but not on a clock
	- neuromorphic architecture
	- IBM had to create a new programming language to make use of this, and new libaries and everything

Technology and Architecture
	- A human scale simulation with 100 trillion synapses executed 1500 times slower than real time using the Sequoia supercomputer, a hypothetical computer to run this in real time would take 12GW, whereas a human only consumes 20W
	- brain uses organic wetwear over silicon-based technologyu
	- there are still limits to silicon based technologies
	- wetwear is a new feild where you can build a computer based on an actual living-neurons, and they actually built a prototype

WetWear

Fluidics
	- fluidic computeing is the idea of sing fluids instead of electrical signals
	- standford used this to develop bubble logi, where a bubble appears or disappears in a channel or whether one is present or not
	- fluidics will not replace silicon as a computing platform, as liquids move far too slowly. instead, it offers a unique way to process and analyze blah blah blah

Chemical Computing
	- this is based on semi-solid chemical where data are represented as varying concentrations
	- brois belousov and anatoly xhabtinsiky, checmical based computers are often budded bz computers
	- it is a natrually parallel design, with computation occuring simuntaneously at every location along a reaction front
	- simple logic gates have been demonstrated blah blah

Moores law
	- Alternatives
		- Multicore-parallelism is inhibited by amdahl's law
			- not everything can run in parallel
		- Intel's 3-d chip
		- Carbon
			- silicon and dark silicon: we can't use it all
			- graphene
			- major issue: no bandgap = NO OFF STATE
			- carbon nanotubes: successfully made by IBM at 10nm wide, in a machine with about 10,000 transistors
			- generally must be incredible pure, hard to produce commercially
			- invertedd transistor: sudden increase in current result in a sudden drop in oltage accross the crcuit , creating what is called negative differential resistance
			- in effect, it COULD work as a logic gate, but no one has yet managed to produce one
			- 10+ years till we see it on the market, if it works

		- Memristors
			- new fundemental cicuit element
			- first proposed in 1961 by leon true
			- it was developed mathmatically, until 2010 when it was actually built it
			- so it can work as a logic gate, and it has memory initself
			- HP is working on this right now
			- IBM has also done work with it
			- It works also like brain neuron as well
			- Intel is also working on this
			- Solution to Vonn Neuman bottle neck because we have memory inside the cpu in each transistor, 
		
		- Silicon Photonics and HP's machine
			- IBM anncounced they had proced nanophotonics, which uses light for information transfer, rather than electrical signals
			- shortly thereafter roced a chip which integrated both electrical and optical components on the same chip, managing to produce data transfer at light speed

		- The issue with the last one is that we don't have a programming language that supports any of this

- Notes:
	- not very professional, well informed, not the best rehersed
