"What is a Disk"

Key Points:
	- How does a hard disk work
	- RAID
	- SSD
	- Alternatives to SSD

Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:
	- I really liked the detail they went into about the alternatives to SSD and why we don't use them right now, and why we have Hard Drives, RAM, and Caches. 
	- Other than that they answered all my questions by the end of the presentation. 

Presentation Strengths
	- They rushed though things a litle bit but things were explained well and straight forward. They also answered qeustions well in easy to understand terms even though the topic wasn't "easy".

Presentation Weaknesses
	- They rushed through it a bit

Things that seemed confusing, incomplete, or piqued your interest:

Presentation Weaknesses:
