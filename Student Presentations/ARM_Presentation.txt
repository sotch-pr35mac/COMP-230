ARM Cortex A8
Keenan and Josh

What is ARM?
	- ARM Holding founded in 1985
	- Parent compnay of the ARM Cortex A8 processor core, and arm risc architecture 
	- lincenses ip cores for braod spectrum use in many electronics
What is a8?
	- Released 2005
	- 32bit unicore processor that implements ARMv7-A architecture
	- Licensed by Apple, Nintendo, TI and many others

It's actually a pretty powerful motherfucking (video), can handle a lot of videos well too

ARMv7 Architecture
	- Similair to MIPS
	- Has own instruction sets, registers, etc.
	- 16 bit operations and 32 bit operations
	- Support for multiworld arithmetic
	- "BLoack" load and store

What exactly does the ARM A8 do?
	- Core != chip
	- defined as "a logical execution unit containing an L1 cache and functional units"

What does it consist of?
	- Single core processor
	- NEON SIMD
	- 13 integer pipeline stages and 10 NEON pipeline stages
	- VFPv3 Floating Point Unit
	- 32 KB instruction cache/ 32 kb data cache
	- clock rate at 1GHz
	- 2014 kb level 2 cache

Pros and Cons
	- Single core so multitasking is not as fast as some dual-core processors
	- NEON SIMD accelerates speed at which signal processing algorithms are performed, allowing for abig increase in performance
	- @ watt thermal design, energy saving
	- A branch mispredict causes a 13- cycle penalty
	- 16 bit "thumb instruction set" saves space by increasing code density

Performance
	- 2 instructions per clock cycle
	- Ideal CPI is .5
	- 80% of stalls are due to pipelining hazards

The Pipelining

ARMv8 (64 bit)
	- RISC Architecture
	- Drips anything unusual from v7
	- PC is no longer one of the registers
	- DRopped Load multiple and store multiple
	- 32 general purpose registers, one hardwired to 0
	- includes divide
