Moore's Law
Cappa and [--]

The integrated circuit is going to get smaller on a exponential cscale

What
DAta
Impact
	Best Case: The computer game insdustry, graphics cards have a ton of transistors
Negative Implication Obsolescence
	- Harmful to environment
	- things go obsolete very rapidly
	- lots of toxic material used in the production of computers
Ultimate Limit
	- "It can''t continue forever"
	- The end of moores law would come between 2013 and 2018 (we have 3 years left)
	- it does seem that the speed of increase has already slowed down. 

How small can a transitor be before they stop working?
	- transistors eventually would reach the limits of minaturization on the atomic size
	- when the transitor size goes to the limit, the transitor count goes to the limit
	- we also hit the limit for sequential clock speed, which means dual core is the way of the future

Multicore
	- The development of the multicore cpu
		- First dual core showed up around 2004
		- quad core and octacore is becoming popular nowadays
		- hexadecane-core super computer developed for some military use

	- why cpu goes to multicore?
		- two way to make computers cpu go faster
		- by making each operation count for more
		- by making more operation happened per second
		- transistor is small enough
		- more enegery and more expense
		- heat will hotter and hotter
advantages and disadvantage of multicore
	- advantage
		- chepaer, and faster than a single core
	- disadvantage
		- parrallel programming needed or it works as a single core

Notes:
-They went very fast. very very fast
