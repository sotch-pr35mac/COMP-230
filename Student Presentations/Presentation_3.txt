Parallel Programming
	- Kamal and YiCong
- Multicore processing is really important
	- Parallel is something that is not going to be handled by hardware, it is the job of the software programmer.

- Pratical Parallel Programming
	- OpenMP
		- Set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables (API)
		- Explicit parallelism (vs. automatic)
		- OpenMP (pre-installed with gcc)
- Parallel Hello World
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main(void) {
		#pragma omp parallel
		printf("Hello World\n");
	}
	
	- A load balance will determine which core takes what task for you

- Parallel Thread Tasking

- Common Errors: Race Condition
	- When one thread is trying to access data that another thread is working on
		
		int a = 0; n = 1000, i;
		
		#pragma omp parallel for
			for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
				a += 1;
			}

	- This is a big big issue, like a seriously big issue

- "Performance doesn't matter if we are getting the wrong results"

- #pragma omp critical
	each thread can run one task at once, so you make it a bit more sequential
- #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+: ave)
	This runs sequential code properly in parallel
- #pragma omp parallel for ordered
	This isn't running it in parallel anymore, it runs faster than criticall, but slower than reduction

- Parallelism depends on Hardware
	- The more cores, the more effective parallel code becomes
	- Innovative techniques are using GPUs to compute
	- Supercomputeres are taking the lead

- To create a parallel program;
	- sequentional computation --> decomposition into subtasks --> assignment to logical processes --> orchestration to parallel programming --> mapping to processors

- Fork / Join Pattern
	- Designed to make divide and conquer algorithms easy to parallelize
	- Tasks are created dynamically
	- Manages tasks accroding to their relationship
	- Parent task creates new tasks (fork) then waits
	- Then it joins them together to get the result
	- They are very similair to recursive programming, its pretty much the same paradigm

- Notes:
	- These guys had a lot of redudant information, but overall it was extremely well informed and engaged and just very good in general
	- They did run a little long
