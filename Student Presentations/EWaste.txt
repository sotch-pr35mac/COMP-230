E-Waste
Simon and Griffin
-Cowboy Economy
	- Motivated by profit
- Cradle to grave
	- Production made for replacement

The problem
- Techonology gets outdated very fast
- Sppeds up cradle to grave model
- each year there are 3 million e waste products
- so what do we do with all these obsolete products?
	- keyi donate
	- keyi recycle
	- keyi sell
	- keyi reng huozhi store

- throwing out is the easiest and worst option
- very irresponsible option
- don't just store old shit because it will end up in the landfill eventually

- Recycle
	- BFR's inhibits fires inside of devices
		- Doesn't really degrate very well
	- PVC's are just awful from start to finish
- Donate
	- give old products to those in need who have none before they go completely obsolute and unusable.
- Resell
	- complicated process
	- Devices lose value like super fast
	- difficult to determine condition
	- Phising and scams
	- Doesn't work for large enterprise companies

- Recycling
	- Mail- in
	- Haul away
	- Drop off
	- Places like Ghana, E-Waste center just dump ewaste into the environment

- China is the biggest ewaste disposal place

- Case Study
	- Apple Inc - Michigan
		- "strict requirements": local and apple repgulations
		- no exporting or contracting
		- however, you can bypass this with permission
		- recycle != downcycle
