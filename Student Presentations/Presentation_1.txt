What is a Diesk?
	Any sotrage mechansm involving a rotating disk.
		- Floppy Disk
		- Optical Disk
		- Hard Drive Disk
	- IBM first Hard Disk
	- How does it work?
		- Magnetic Hard Disk Structure
			- Platters
			- Tracks
			- Sectors
		- Read write
			- Moveable read write head, each plattery gets its own read write head
		- Step 1: Seek
			- Operating System Interaction
			- Seek
		- Step 2: Rotational Latency
			- Average rotaional latency = .5 rotation / 5400 rpm = 5.6 ms
		- Step 3: Disk Transfer Time
			- Is a function of sector size, rotation time, shenme shenme shenme
			- Sub-Step 1: Starting Position
			- Sub-Step 2: Seek Time
			- Sub-Step 3: Rotational Latency
RAID:
	- Redundant Array of Independant Disks
	- Storage Virtualization
	- Small Form Factor, 1987, Berkeley
	- How does RAID Work?
		- Multiple drives
		- Software or Hardware implementation
			- Either OS or Drive firmware
			- Dedicated RAID controller
		- "Levels"
		- !! I'm still not entirely sure why you would want to use RAID, what is RAID in simple terms? !!
		- RAID 0
			- Stiping
				- Distribute file across each disk as evenly as possible
				- The throughput of one disk times the amount of disks
			- No mirroring
			- No parity
				- Check for data corruption checking the "hash" (parity bit) of sorts
			- If any disk fails in the set of disks, you lose the entire volume
		- RAID 1
			- Mirroring
				- Increasing read performance
				- All you data is copied accross all disks
				- Does not protect against data corruption
				- but you can increase the read time because you can read in from each drive all at the same time
			- No parity
			- No striping
		- RAID 2: 
			- No one uses this
			- Stipes data at the bit leve
			- Using Hamming Code as a form of parity
				- if you use more htan one parity bit you can point to the data error within a given value
			- So there are like a lot of drawbacks
				- all of the disks are sync
			- if you want to read anything, all the drives have to reach the same index at the same time
			- The Hamming Code calculatinos are pretty expensive
		- RAID 3:
			- Stripes data at byte level
			- Has a dedicated parity disk
		- RAID 4:
			- Block level striping
			- Has a dedicated parity disk
		- RAID 5: 
			- Block Level Striping
			- Distributed Parity
			- Requires at least 3 disks
		- RAID 6:
			- Block level stiping
			- Adds another parity block
				- This just adds another layer of redundancy
			- This is pretty much just like RAID 5 except with a dip in performance due to more parity calculations
		- Non-Standard RAID:
			- Nested (Hybrid) RAID
				- RAID 10
				- A RAID within A RAID, either hardware of virtual or both
			- Intel Matrix RAID
				- Partitioning RAID volumes for quicker speed

SSD "Revolution"
	- Why SSD
		- They are just better, storage not as good, but they are fucking fast
	- What is an SSD?
		- No read write heads, they just have integrated circuit assemblies
		- NAND Flash
	- NAND Flash
		- Floating Gate Transistor
		- slower than DRAM, much faster than HHD
		- Keeps memory without power
	- Pros and Cons
		- Pros
			- Faster
			- quieter
			- draws less power
			- more rugged
			- eas adoption
		- cons
			- expensive
			- low capacity
				- thousands of dollars for 1.2 TB, whereas 3TB hdd for $300
			- wear out
				- NAND memory can only be run so many times before it runs out
	- Alternatives
		- DRAM
			- historically made from DRAM, INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
			- Non-volital, when the power is off, you lose all of your data
		- NV-DIMM
			- On power down all of the down all data is transfered to NAND
			- On power up all the data transfere to NV-DIM
		- UltraDIMM
			- Just beter and more expensive nv-dimm
		- SSHDS
			- hybrid drive (like what i have)
			- Hard drive is used as the main memory, and then SSD is used as a cache for the hard drive
