GPU
Adian Liam and Ed

- Functionality

- Usually located on the video card
- Video card
	- Translates hardware into video display device
	- GPU is Main Component
- CPU vs. GPU
	- CPU
		- all purpose
	- GPU
		- handles polygons

- History of the GPU
	- Sepcialized chips for graphics showed up in the 1970s
	- Made their explicit way to pcs by hte 80s, and became more general
	- These early gpus

- 1990s
	- graphic chips become more general, ore comonplace as a result
	- much development driven by gaming
	- chips consistently adopt more of the graphics, pipeline, leaves less to the CPU
- True GPUs
	- in 2001, programmable piplines were instroduced to GPUs, and would become a trend
	- parallel processing develops
	- GPU development exceeded moore's law

- Modern GPUS/ A look forward
	- GPUs grow to become more flexible, more similar to CPUs
	- Parallelism and prgrammability rise
	- GPUs melding into CPUs as they become more general purpose?

- How does the GPU Work?
	1. Each shape is represented mathematically
	2. Each shape is "rasterized" (filled in)
	3. The pixel's color is determined
	4. The pixels are dhown
	- Fixed Pipeline, (as opposed to programmable pipelines)

- Triangles
	- Each shape is modeled using triangles
	- Each triangle is comprised of points that are reprsented by vectors
	- Each shape is modeled in three dimentions

- Vectors and matrices
	- The points are represente dby vectors with 4 coordinates (3 spacial)
		- This allows for eassier transormation of points
	- Shapes are transformed using algorithims that utilize linear algebra
	- Output is common coordinate system with the view at the origin

- Lighting
	- Next the color is determined
		- the effect of individual each light is summed
		- This is calculated using the dot product of two vectors

- Rasterization
	- Each surface is rasterized (turned into pixels)
	- Using matrix transformation, each surface is projected to the viewer
		- Each pizel can be rasterized independently, leading to parallel processing

- Hidden surfaces
	- Shapes overlap shapes
	- To show the closest shape, a depth buffer is used
		- Each shape has a number indicating its distance to the viewer
		- This number is compared and a lower number replaces a higher number

- Fixed Function vs Programmable
	- So what we have gone through thus far has been called Fixed Function, now we are going to talk about how it is different from a Programmable model

- Programmable Pipelines
	- Fixed functions were effective but offered little to no flexablity
	- Programmable pipelines gave deeveloper a chance to utilizes many new effects
		- This is done through something called Shader, which is just like a plugin

	- New abilities
		- images like the one with water is only possible with a programmable pipeline
		- GPU have recently begun to be used to process general purpose, math heavy tasks such as a stastical processeing or breaking string hashes (like mining bit coins)

Notes:
	- They were chopping and not very engaged, they said um a lot, and didn't seem to have a very well reheresed presentation at all
	- It was very rushed
