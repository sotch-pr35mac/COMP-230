Multiplication:
	- So we have two parts: multiplicand, multiplier, and the product
	- We can do binary multiplication the same way we do in decimal
	- n bit multiplicand * n bit multiplier, we can an n bit product at most
	- All we are really doing is testing the multipliers digits one by one agains the rest of the mutlicands digits
	- Then we add up all the intermediate values together and get the product

	- So here we have a little bit of a flow chart
		- Start 
		- Test Mutliplier 0
			- If result 0
				- shift the multiplicand register to the left one bit
				- GOTO sll
			- If result 1
				- Add multiplicand to product and place result in product register
				- GOTO sll
		- Multiplicand sll
			- GOTO  multiplier srl
		- Mulitplier srl
			- GOTO: 32 reps
		- 32 repts
			- If we have done the n-amount of bits GOTO: DONE
			- If we have not done n-amount of bits GOTO: START

- Notes:
	- Could have been more engaging but was really informative
